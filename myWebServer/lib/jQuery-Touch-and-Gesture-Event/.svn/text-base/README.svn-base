NOTE 
Chrome will return true for touches support as it implements the touch events on all devices regardless 
of touch input support on a particular device. You may want to add additional checks using the 
userAgent using something like:

/chrome/.test( navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase()

though that's not ideal. For more information see discussions:
